			<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
			<p>
				Our services may contain links to other websites, applications, and
				online services. If you choose to visit a third party service or click
				on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party's
				website, application, or online service. The fact that we link to a
				website, content is not an endorsement, authorization or representation
				of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of
				their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not
				exercise control over third party websites or services.
			</p>
			<h2>Third Party Privacy Policies</h2>
			<p>
				Our Privacy Policy does not apply to other websites. Thus, we are
				advising you to consult the respective Privacy Policies of these
				third-party ad servers for more detailed information. It may include
				their practices and instructions about how to opt-out of certain
				options.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can choose to disable cookies through your individual browser
				options. To know more detailed information about cookie management with
				specific web browsers, it can be found at the browsers' respective
				websites.
			</p>
			<h2>Cookies</h2>
			<p>
				Cookies are small pieces of data stored on your device by your browser.
				They serve various purposes, such as remembering your preferences,
				enhancing user experience, and facilitating authentication.
			</p>
			<p>
				At our site, we utilize third-party authentication services, including
				Google OAuth, to secure and streamline the login process. When you log
				in using Google OAuth, a cookie is generated and stored on your device.
				This cookie is essential for the proper functioning of our
				authentication system.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Google OAuth cookie contains a unique identifier that helps us
				recognize your authenticated session. It enables you to access our
				application seamlessly without the need to re-enter your credentials
				repeatedly during a single session.
			</p>
			<p>
				It's important to note that these cookies do not store personal
				information directly on our servers. Instead, they serve as tokens that
				establish a secure connection between your browser and the
				authentication provider, in this case, Google. This enhances the
				security of the authentication process while providing a more
				user-friendly experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				By using our site and opting for third-party authentication, you consent
				to the use of cookies for authentication purposes. You can manage your
				cookie preferences through your browser settings.
			</p>
